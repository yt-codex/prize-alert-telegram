# Main configuration file for Prize Alert Telegram.
#
# This file is designed for non-developers:
# - Edit values carefully.
# - Keep indentation with spaces only (no tabs).
# - Do not remove field names unless you know what you are doing.

# ---- Alert threshold ----
# The app only sends a Telegram alert when the fetched prize is GREATER than this amount.
# To make alerts happen more often, lower threshold.amount.
# To make alerts happen less often, raise threshold.amount.
threshold:
  amount: 2500000
  currency: "SGD"

# ---- Prize data source ----
# By default, this app expects a JSON API source (mode: json_api).
#
# Security notes:
# - Do NOT put secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) in this file.
# - If the source requires authentication, pass secrets via
#   GitHub Actions environment variables / GitHub Secrets.
# - Prefer official/authorized APIs (or your own endpoint)
#   rather than scraping HTML pages.
prize_source:
  # JSON endpoint that returns the next draw prize data.
  url: "https://example.com/api/next-draw"

  # Dot-path to the prize amount field inside the JSON response.
  # Example for this default: data.next_draw.prize

  # Optional HTTP headers for the source request.
  # Keep empty by default.
  headers: {}
